Repository containing attempts to construct spin-half analogues of elliptic diffusion equations.

dirac.py - script trying to do anisotropic diffusion via a Dirac-like equation; straight magnetic fieldlines.  Known problems indicated in comments at top of script.

dirac_experiment.py - script testing isotropic Dirac-like equation with a solution depending on x and y.  Known problems indicated in comments at top of script.

DeluzetNarski.py - script implementing simple cases (scalar, not spin-half) similar to content of "A two field interated asymptotic-preserving method for highly anisotropic elliptic equations" by Deluzet and Narski.  Does straight and bent magnetic fieldlines and so can demonstrate null-space problem and "locking" problem.

unit_square.msh - crude triangle mesh of unit square.

unit_square_test.msh - more refined triangle mesh of unit square.

Note: there is no script testing bent magnetic fieldlines for spin-half yet, so cannot say anything re "locking" problem in the spin-half case.

Note: all the spin-half material is provisional and might be misconceived and/or wrongly implemented.
